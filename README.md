# YOLO v1: You Only Look Once - Real-Time Object Detection

This repository contains an implementation of YOLO v1 (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. YOLO v1 is known for its speed and accuracy, making it suitable for applications requiring real-time processing. This implementation is built from scratch, with detailed explanations and well-documented code to facilitate understanding and further development.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Achieve high-speed object detection with YOLO's unified architecture.
- **Single Neural Network**: The entire detection pipeline is a single convolutional neural network, simplifying the model and speeding up the process.
- **Bounding Box Predictions**: Predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in a single evaluation.
- **End-to-End Training**: Train the model end-to-end on a diverse dataset for robust object detection.
- **Easy Customization**: Modular code structure allows for easy customization and experimentation.
